# FileConverterV1

This version **does not** contain methods.

I was asked to write code to convert between different file types when I interviewed for a developer position. I would be allotted 1 hour to write this functionality.

To prepare for this evaluation, I wrote the code housed in this repo. Knowing that I would be short on time during this evaluation, I wrote a second version of the code housed in the [FileConverterV2](https://github.com/heathermortensen/FileConverterV2) repo. I then compared both repos for complexity and the number of lines of code. This evaluation helped me form a strategy to move as fast as possible during the upcoming evaluation.



| Repository Name | Lines of Code |
| --------------- | ------------- |
| FileConverterV1 | 366           |
| FileConverterV2 | 483           |

For lines of code, use the this bash pipe command:

```bash
git ls-files | xargs wc -l
```
